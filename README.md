## üë®‚Äçüíª Junior Full-Stack Web and Mobile Developer | Passionate Learner | Tech Enthusiast

Hello, I'm **Eyob Simachew**, a self-taught developer from **Ethiopia**. I‚Äôm passionate about coding, building personal projects, and continuously improving my skills. I started my journey in development through online courses and reading documentation, and I love experimenting with new technologies and frameworks. When I'm not coding, I'm diving into my side projects or exploring new ideas to improve as a developer.

### üå± **What I Do**

I primarily focus on **full-stack web development** and **mobile app development**. I'm passionate about creating solutions that help developers and users alike. Right now, I'm working on **two passion projects**: 

- **Telegram Analytics Platform**: A tool to analyze and track Telegram data.
- **Develevate**: An app designed to help developers stay productive and organized in their learning journey.

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Technologies I Work With**
